"INC-1201","Terror Attack Johannesburg, South Africa","10/27/2022 5:45 AM","Johannesburg","South Africa","The US embassy in the capital Pretoria issued an terror alert on 26 October. It warned that terrorists may be plotting to attack large gatherings of people at an unspecified location in Sandton (Johannesburg, Gauteng province) on 29 October. According to the embassy, further details of the plot are not available, however it has advised people to avoid large public gatherings in Sandton over the coming days. People should exercise vigilance and anticipate a heightened security posture over the coming days.

  MORE DETAIL   
The US embassy rarely issues terror alerts for South Africa. In June 2016, the embassy issued an alert warning of plots against locations frequented by US citizens, including upscale shopping centers in Cape Town (Western Cape province) and Johannesburg. In September 2015, the embassy issued an alert warning about a potential attack on US interests and facilities. Previous warnings were also issued in 2010 and 2009.
Regardless, there have been no major terrorist attacks in South Africa in recent years. Terrorist incidents in recent decades have been small-scale, infrequent, and commonly also linked to criminality. In 2018 one man was killed and two others injured during an attack on a Shia Muslim Mosque in Durban (KwaZulu-Natal province). 
Although the potential for an attack cannot be disregarded, terrorism risks in South Africa continue to be low. The country is a potential target for militant groups given the high number of attractive targets and the presence of sympathisers to extremist groups, including the transnational extremist Islamic State (IS) group. However, South Africa's long-held relative neutral foreign policy and the absence of active domestic terrorist groups reduce the likelihood for an attack. Additionally, terrorist groups have prioritised using the country as a recruitment, transit, and financing hub rather than a target for attack. The security forces also continue to report relative success in thwarting terrorist activities.","Terror Attack Johannesburg, South Africa","Safety (Terrorism, War, Civil-unrest)","Closed","","","Country"

"INC-0229","Super Typhoon - Hagibis","10/8/2019 2:59 AM","","Japan","The tropical cyclone forecast has been issued by Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on October 09, 2019, 09:00:00 GMT. Super Typhoon - Hagibis, currently equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane (on the Saffir-Simpson scale), is located in the NW Pacific Ocean with maximum sustained winds of 259 km/h (161 mph), and wind gusts up to 315 km/h (196 mph). 

According to this forecast (#17), the cyclone is headed North at about 19 km/h (12 mph), and is expected to remain at this strength over the next 24 hours. 
It is cautioned, however, that the storm's actual position may shift significantly over the next few days. 

Based on the current forecast (the storm's center and path), Super Typhoon - Hagibis is not expected to cross-over a major land-mass within the next 48-72 hours (although it may impact smaller islands along the way). 

For the extended forecast, an estimated 8.24 Million people, 3.17 Million households, and $1.94 Trillion (USD) of infrastructure are potentially exposed to moderate to severe damaging winds (with damage expected closer to the shores). 

All shorelines in the path of the storm are exposed to potential storm surge, and inland areas within the proximity of the storm are exposed to potential flooding. 
Additional updates will be provided as they become available by official sources.","","Natural disaster","Closed","","","Country"

Thousands evacuated as eruptions continue; Alert Level 3 remains.","7/1/2021 4:00 PM","","Philippines","Multiple sources are reporting continued volcanic activity in Taal Volcano. Updates on Thursday, July 1 indicate that the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has raised the Alert Level to Level 3. This indicates magmatic intrusion on the main crater which may lead to further eruptions. The level was raised after minor phreatomagmatic activity with a plume rising 3,280 feet (one kilometer, 0.6 miles) above the main crater. 

Thousands of residents of Taal Volcano Island and high-risk barangays of Agoncillo and Laurel, Batangas are under evacuation due to high risk of pyroclastic currents and volcanic tsunamis in the area. PHIVOLCS has recommended that no one enter the island, with entry into the Daang Kastila fissure and Taal lake completely restricted. Approximately 717,000 people live within 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of the summit. There have been no initial reports regarding associated injuries or disruptions. 

In the past 24 hours, at least 10 volcanic earthquakes were recorded. The volcano has emitted high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) for the past day with levels reaching over 6,685 tonnes of sulphur dioxide (SO2) per day on Wednesday, June 30. Gas-steam plumes were recorded rising at least 6,561 feet (2 kilometers, 1.2 miles) above the crater lake. Volcanic fog has reportedly affected Taal Calder. Aviation authorities have advised all pilots to avoid flying within proximity of the island due to the risk of a collision with ballistic ejecta and suspended airborne ash. 

Previous reports indicated that villages Banyaga, Bilibinwang, and Subic Ilaya west of the summit experienced vegetation die off and breathing difficulties as a result of acid rain. Acid rain is corrosive and damages all vegetation, taking place when sulfur dioxide (SO2) reacts with water droplets in the atmosphere.","Taal Volcano ?

Updated sources report an unspecified number of injuries including at least ten police officers and three journalists, as well as at least 180 arrests including at least 60 in Rotterdam, 12 in Geleen, nine in Amsterdam, eight in Almelo, and several in Den Bosch; figures are expected to rise as more information becomes available. Officials were also seeking out and detaining those believed responsible for inciting the violence, including at least four people in Goes and two others in Kattendjike. In Rotterdam, the police fired warning shots to deter looters outside an electronics store and used tear gas and a water cannon during clashes in the Beijerlandselaan and Groene Hilledijk area against up to 300 protesters and 80 looters, who used heavy fireworks against a police station on nearby Sandelingplein. Elsewhere, the police responded to localized outbreaks of groups numbering up to 150 people seeking police confrontations, throwing debris and fireworks, looting businesses, vandalizing property, and setting fires. Affected areas included Molukkenstraat and Javastraat in Amsterdam, Markt and Heistraat in Helmond, Hobbemastraat in The Hague, Belgielaan in Schalkwijk, Keizer Karelplein in Nijmegen, and Hinthamerstraat in Den Bosch as well as in Alphen, Amersfoot, Best, Den Bosch, Enschede, Geleen, Vlissingen, Zwolle, and elsewhere. Protests in some areas dispersed before the curfew, and officials reported calm has been restored to many areas. Still, heightened security presences and associated disruption are likely to persist overnight in public spaces and major thoroughfares in city centers, and additional clashes between protesters and the police cannot be ruled out. 

On Saturday, January 23, authorities introduced a mandatory nightly curfew from 9:00 PM to 4:30 AM local time. That night, demonstrators set fire to a COVID-19 testing facility in Urk in protest against COVID-19 restrictions. On Sunday, January 24, hundreds of people demonstrated in at least 12 cities in the Netherlands. At least 245 people were arrested countrywide. In Amsterdam, the police used water cannons, batons, and mounted units to disperse approximately 1,500 people, some lighting fireworks, in the Museumplein area; at least 190 people were arrested in the capital. In Eindhoven, large-scale looting and vandalism broke out as the police used water cannons and tear gas to push protesters from 18 Septemberplein toward Eindhoven Central train station; at least 55 people were arrested, and the station was temporarily evacuated. Far-right groups including Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident (PEGIDA) and Netherlands in Resistance initially called for and then ostensibly canceled official demonstrations in these areas, but many supporters still turned out. Additional unrest involving dozens of people occurred on Sunday evening in The Hague, Venlo, Enschede, Tilburg, Stein, Arnhem, Apeldoorn, Oosterhout, Roermond, and Breda. There were widespread reports of localized looting, vandalism, and a number of vehicles set alight, in some cases causing temporary disruption to public transit services. At least one officer was injured. In response to the disturbances, officials in some cities have issued emergency orders strengthening police enforcement powers and sealing road access to city centers.

"INC-0812","Transportation: Lockdown in India","11/19/2021 2:00 PM","New Delhi, Delhi","India","On Tuesday, the air quality index (AQI) for most reporting stations in and around Delhi remained at either Very Unhealthy or Hazardous levels as the region continues to experience a sharp seasonal increase in air pollution. The government of Delhi closed schools until further notice, banned some construction work until November 21, and, along with the Supreme Court, is advising businesses in Delhi to allow remote work. Work-from-home plans and some traffic restrictions have also been implemented in the neighboring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Most coal-burning and other thermal power plants within 300 kilometers (186 miles) of Delhi have reportedly been closed until November 30, some industrial facilities using fuel sources other than natural gas may be required to close, cargo trucks carrying nonessential goods have been restricted from entering Delhi, and restrictions are in place on diesel vehicles more than ten years old and gasoline vehicles more than 15 years old until November 21, according to media reports. Hospitals in Delhi have reported an uptick in patients experiencing respiratory issues, and authorities are advising people to limit time spent outside. The Supreme Court will meet again on the pollution topic on Wednesday, and the Delhi government is reportedly expected to propose a lockdown for the coming weekend, along with a week-long extension of the advisory for remote work. 

Assessment: Air quality generally declines drastically in Delhi during the winter months due to weather conditions, factory smoke, emissions from vehicles, and the use of fire to clear agricultural fields in the surrounding regions. In addition to the aforementioned anti-pollution measures, many types of firecrackers were recently banned during Diwali and other festivals, and the government last year placed additional restrictions on establishing new manufacturing facilities in Delhi. An improvement in conditions from the current air quality deterioration is not expected until later this week. Those with operations in Delhi are advised to be aware of the potential for weekend lockdown restrictions or other measures that could be implemented in the coming days and associated disruptions.

According to Turkey?s interior ministry, the epicentre of the quake was near the south-eastern city of Gaziantep, with nine other major cities affected: Kahramanmaras, Hatay, Osmaniye, Adiyaman, Malatya, Sanliurfa, Adana, Diyarbakir and Kilis. Following the earthquake, Turkey?s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) launched a search and rescue mission. Turkey?s defence ministry stated that the armed forces had established an air corridor to enable the transit of medical and search and rescue teams in earthquake-affected areas.

A number of aftershocks and a second large quake with a magnitude of 7.5 have occurred. At the moment, the amount of damage done by the second quake is unclear.

The disaster is highly likely to impact operations throughout south-eastern Turkey and neighbouring countries in the coming weeks.","","Geophysical (Earthquake, landslide, Tsunamis)","Active Crisis","","","Country"
"INC-0950","Meteorological: Flooding","3/1/2022 10:50 AM","Puget Sound","United States","Multiple sources report flooding across the Puget Sound region following heavy rain from an atmospheric river passing through the area. An atmospheric river is a portion of the atmosphere that carries large amounts of water away from the Earth?s tropical regions and toward the poles. Additional rain is expected through Wednesday, February 2, which may exacerbate current flooding conditions. 

Several roadways have been closed or deemed impassable due to high water, particularly in King County. There has been no indication of any widespread damage or evacuations. The heavy rain has also contributed to minor landslides across the area, including two in the north Renton area along Lake Washington and along US-101 near Tacoma. The landslides have contributed to power outages and road closures but have not resulted in any major structural damage or injuries. Authorities have warned that the threat of landslides remains high as additional rain falls across saturated soil today and tomorrow. 

River flooding is also impacting the area. The Snoqualmie River near both Carnation and Snoqualmie Falls has reached Major flood stage. As of Tuesday morning, several other bodies of water have reached Moderate flood stage including the Tolt River near Carnation, Issaquah Creek near Issaquah, the Snoqualmie River near Snohomish and Monroe, Nisqually River near National, Cowlitz River near Randle, Newaukum River near Chehalis, Skookumchuck River near Bucoda, and the Chehalis River near Grand Mound. Roadways in low-lying areas and areas near bodies of water are likely to be impacted.

River Flood Warnings and River Warnings remain in effect for several areas across the region. Expect associated disruptions. Heed local warnings and avoid traveling on flooded roadways.","Meteorological: Flooding","Meteorological (Tornado, Hurricane, Floods)","Closed","","",""

"INC-0481","Security: Protest","6/10/2019 10:51 AM","Hong Kong","China","Updated media sources are reporting that up to 6,000 riot police were deployed across Hong Kong to quell pro-democracy demonstrations held on China?s National Day on Thursday, October 1. An unspecified number of pro-democracy protesters marched across Tsuen Wan and central Causeway Bay, and sporadic smaller demonstrations occurred throughout the city. There were also reports of a small number of pro-Beijing demonstrators that were permitted to gather. Reports indicate that officers patrolled multiple shopping areas and issued stop and search activities targeting young people. Officers reportedly enclosed journalists in a designated pen area, where only vetted journalists were able to leave the area.  At least 86 pro-democracy protesters were arrested, including four elected local district politicians. The demonstration, organized by students and young people, was called on to urge for the release of 12 Hong Kong activists, democratic freedoms, and independence from Beijing. This was the first organized protest since China?s implementation of the national security law on Tuesday, June 30. As previously reported, COVID-19 gathering restrictions are still in place, and organizers advised potential participants to judge the risks of taking part in the protest for themselves, as the event was not approved by the police. MTR services were reportedly suspended for the night of October 1, but operations have resumed.

Previous Updates:

Demonstrations across Hong Kong broke out in June 2019, originally called by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), in opposition to a proposed law allowing extraditions to mainland China. While the extradition bill was withdrawn, the CHRF and its supporters expanded their demands to include the release of detained protesters, the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, an investigation into police responses to the protests, universal suffrage for local elections, and retraction of the use of the word ?riot? to describe the protests. In 2020, demonstrators have also protested a national security law for Hong Kong passed by the Chinese central government and a ban on insults to the Chinese national anthem. Some demonstrations in 2019 saw participation levels as high as several hundred thousand or more than one million; however, the size and frequency of protests have declined this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak and greater government restrictions on the protest movement. Individuals are advised to monitor developments and to avoid any demonstrations due to the potential for violence.","Security: Protest","Safety (Terrorism, War, Civil-unrest)","Closed","","Hong Kong - Science Park 01602","Country"

"INC-0554","Quality issue in SRC","4/23/2021 10:44 AM","New Kensington","United States","Regarding the New Kensington Plant. I believe you are aware of a Quality issue in SRC. This issue is impacting all products in my two plants with the exception of POC's (Portable Oxygen concentrators), Cough Assist 2 and Trilofgy Evo. There is a number of suppliers that are impacting the plant, but for the 2 biggest ones associated with Dream Station to are Technimark and Sunningdale. Note Dream Staion 2 is a newly released product (Next generation CPAP to replace Dream Station1). Due to the Quality issue impacting the DS1 we needed to put our full attention and ramp to DS2, which is not impacted. We have exceeded build plan quantities associated with original plan for the release. A number of the Suppliers are still running off single cavity tools and the multi-cavity tools were not to come online until mid-May. So with shifting and ramping to DS2 before expected we have this situation. Additionally, there have been transportation challenges since some material was coming via boat as well items from Mexico have been delayed at the border. We will be furloughing approximately  60 people starting Monday (5/3) for two weeks until we can be in a position to run full throttle on DS1 and DS2. Currently in a TUV MDSAP re-cert audit all day today at the New Kensington plant (RIST). Yesterday was a RIMR (Murrysville), all being conducted remotely.

In October 2021, Russia began moving troops and military equipment near the border with Ukraine, reigniting concerns over a potential invasion. Commercial satellite imagery and social media posts from November and December 2021 showed armor, missiles, and other heavy weaponry moving toward Ukraine with no official explanation.


Russian foreign ministry issued a set of demands which included a ban on Ukraine entering the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a reduction of NATO troops and military equipment in eastern Europe in order for its military forces to be withdrawn. The United States and other NATO allies rejected these demands and have warned Russia of retaliation if Ukraine is invaded, including economic sanctions, and other assistance has been deployed to Ukraine, including small arms and other defensive weaponry.
Currently:
On Feb 24th, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine using its full military capabilities, including the air force, missiles, armed forces and infantry.
Feb 26th, ?	The UK?s Ministry of Defence has announced that the Russian armored forces are progressing towards Kyiv from multiple fronts in an attempt to encircle the city, as of early morning hours (local time) on February 26.","","Armed conflict","Closed","","Kiev - Center","Group"

By FRANS DREISSEN AND GERT VAN HARSKAMP

EINDHOVEN - Eindhoven-based group VDL suffered a cyber attack on Thursday morning. All companies of VDL Groep both at home and abroad have been hit.

At various locations it was impossible or only partially possible to function, a spokesperson said. For example, at VDL Nedcar in Born where Minis and BMWs are built, some of the staff were forced to go home.

The cyber attack is aimed at the head office in Eindhoven, but also has consequences for the other 106 operating companies. Within the group, however, the full impact and the extent to which the various operating companies of the family conglomerate were affected are still being determined.

Some of these companies, like VDL Nedcar, have had to partially stop production. Exactly which VDL companies were affected is not yet clear. A spokesman cannot yet say much more about the issue and the impact. For example, it is not yet clear whether the hackers had access to company-sensitive information.

VDL will come out with more information in the course of the day.","","Cyber Security","Closed","","Best","Market"

Note - all action were created on June 30th. As no due date was defined, a default due date of June 30th was used.
After several weeks - the project moved to being monitored in weekly meetings with Gav Yam. No additional actions opened for the team.

Update - Nov 6th - periodical meetings are conducted with Gav Yam, it seems that the main risk of vibration is not materializing.

Update - Jan 4th - periodical meetings have stopped in the last few weeks.  Still waiting to hear about the defined solutions on how to overcome a possible risk of not having enough access to conduct maintenance in the electricity and generator rooms (due to the location of a pipe).

Update Feb 12th - periodical meetings took place.  
After a meeting with ""Gav Yam"", the BCM manager (Hillel - me) decided to escalate the situation as the suggested solution of moving the water pipes was not progressing.
Jan 24th 2023 - e-mail (attached) was sent to the site leader explaining the risk. 
Jan 31st 203 - a dedicated meeting with the site leader (Efrat Ori, facilities management and BCM) was conducted - summary attached. The risk was accepted under the assumption that a solution is expected soon. 

Currently waiting the activity to take place.","","Other","Closed","","Haifa","Site"

The storm is traveling northwestward at six miles (ten kilometers) per hour, while exhibiting maximum sustained winds of 52 miles (83 kilometers) per hour with gusts of up to 63 miles (102 kilometers) per hour. In-Fa made landfall over the island of Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province as a tropical storm early Sunday, July 25 local time. The typhoon is expected to bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges throughout the impacted regions. 

In-Fa has caused power outages and evacuations in multiple areas of Japan?s Okinawa Prefecture. Over 1,400 properties are without power in Miyakojima, and over 2,100 properties have experienced power outages on the main island of Okinawa due to the storm. Over 55,000 people are under Level 4 evacuation orders in Miyakojima, while at least 15,900 people are also under Level 4 evacuation orders in Ishigaki, Taketomi, and Okinawa City. There have been no initial reports regarding the expected duration of those evacuation orders. There have also been no initial reports regarding any injuries in Okinawa Prefecture due to the approach of In-Fa.

Tropical Storm Risk has issued a Yellow Alert for China and the city of Shanghai within the next 12 hours, as well as for Ningbo and Hangzhou within the next 24 hours.
